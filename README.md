## Folders
1. The `lsh` folder contains source codes for LSH approach
2. `CNN.ipynb` is the source code for CNN approach
3. `README.md`(this file) contains compile instruction and citations
4. TODO: paper.pdf
## Compile Instruction
### CNN Method
1. download CNN.ipynb
2. open `CNN.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook or other Notebook environment. Note: Google Colab might not work due to memory limitation, local environment is recommended.
3. run each code block from start.
### Nearest Neighbor LSH Method
1. `git clone` this repo
2. `cd lsh`
3. run `python lsh_util.py` inside a venv and see the output
